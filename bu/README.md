### Weather Analysis Dashboard

I created a website based upon the Weather Analysis project. The website contains a navigation bar on each of the pages for easy access. The pages consist of a landing page with contains an explanation of the project as well as a link to each of the main visualizations. 

Each  visualization for the selected comparison (latitude vs. max temperature and location vs. max temperature, latitude vs. humidity and location vs. humidity, latitude vs. cloud cover and location vs. cloud cover, or latitude vs. wind speed and location vs. wind speed). Additonally, each page includes an analysis based on the original project

I also crated comparisons pages which show either all four latitude versus, or location versus images to compare to one-another. 

Finally, I created a data page to show the data used.
